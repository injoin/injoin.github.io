# InJoin Website
This is the repository for the InJoin website.

## Developing the website
It's easy to get up and running to develop our website locally.  
Just follow the these instructions:

* Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on your machine
* Install SASS:

  ```bash
  $ gem install sass
  ```
* Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/injoin/injoin.github.io.git
  ```
* Run Jekyll in the repository you just cloned:

  ```bash
  $ jekyll server --watch
  ```

Now, just open a browser in the http://localhost:4000 address and start developing!
